deviceId,temperature or acceleration , timestamp : at the end it will also use structured streaming

spark removes i/o and network latency in shuffles since rdds are in memory 
map functions are transformations that process the portion of rdds in each partition and lets  a new rdd be loaded in cache of the cluster
once reduce is called , then , without any shuffle , the reduce method , which is an action , does the computation on the entire rdd and without
any shuffle in the reduce phase here , the reduced data is collected in driver machine 
the purpose of keys , shuffles and paired rdds are only here while distributing the data on to the cluster , most preferably to handle the skew 
of the data

multithreading
use executor service to fork threads 
first use stream parallel 
then use map on that stream 
in that use callable
in callable thread 
and should return future or completeable future
